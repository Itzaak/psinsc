psi - reference to one of the names behind the phenomenological theory of Vitaly Ginzburg and Lev Landau.

SC - reference to superconductivity.
##
Python framework for generalized time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (gTDGL) model based on finite elements method (FEM).

Model breakdown utilizes the FEniCSx Unified Form Language (UFL) domain specific language. Equations are represented in UFL notation.

Solvers are based on the DOLFINx backend and PETSc therein.
